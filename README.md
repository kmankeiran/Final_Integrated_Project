# Final_Integrated_Project  

## Logo  
We designed our logo to look like a historical building in London to relate the logo to the website. The logo is related to the Middlesex County Courthouse Building, we did the Middlesex  County Courthouse building because it is the oldest building made in London that still stands. We traced the building and added a gradient layer to it. We used two different fonts with the logo, the font for Arcitecture is 'Lovely Home' and the font for London is 'Verdana'.

## Photos  
We grabbed the old photos of the arcitectural buildings from the lonon library website, and the photography of the new buildings were taken by Keiran and edited in photoshop by Yullia. She added a gradient layer to the photos and edited the color balance, hue and saturation, brightness and contrast, and edited the vignette.

## Web Layout  
We created 3 pages, a Home page, a Gallery information page, and a Contact page. The layout looks historical with our logo on the top left and bottom left of the page, with a navigation bar to the right of the page and a search bar and the top background looking aged. The home page contains a small headline giving a brief description about the historical sites with 4 photos of the historical destinations in the present. The footer has the logo with a navigation bar underneath the logo, to the left are symbols of social media sites that link to them.

## Building History Page  
The building history page contains 3 different destinations with a before and after picture of the historyical building, and an artical of the history behind the building. The destinations are the Middlesex County Courte House, The University of Western Ontario, and St.Peter's Cathedral Basilica.

## Contact Page  
The contact page has a form you can submit where you enter your name, email, phone number, and a personal comment if you want. On the other side of the page is the phone number (fake number, not important) and the mailing address (also not important) with a live update of a google maps destination, where we are located. And at the bottom of the page is the logo and navigation bar with the social media website links on the bottom right.
